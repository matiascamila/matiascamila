Hi there!

👋 I'm Camila, current working with Financial Risk, also I'm Engineering student, but more then this, I'm curious about ways to make technology work for me not the other way around.

👀 I'm interested in use programing for routine automatization.

🌱 I'm currently learning VBA e SQL, but I'm also interested in JAVA, it's my next target.

💞️ I could collaborate with Financial and Excel/VBA knowledge for now.
